{\emph{Software Developer} \\
    After a year and a half of interning, I was asked to officially join the team as the sole developer of the first rewrite of VG-Bio's Android application.
    Before completely switching to Android, I helped rearchitect and rewrite the company's REST API, and design a client SDK for the API.
    These projects helped further affirm and develop my capabilities in test-driven development and architecture for large enterprise-level applications.
    I am only just beginning my work in Android, but I expect to further develop and challenge my skills and knowledge.
